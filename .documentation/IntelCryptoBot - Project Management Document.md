# Project Management Documentation - IntelCryptoBot

## Task Management Instructions
- Tasks are tagged as Done, ToDo or Backlog
- ToDo tasks are prioritized by their order in the list
- Done tasks are ordered chronologically from top to bottom

## Project Scope Note
- Focus on Solana blockchain integration first
- Later phases will expand to other blockchain networks
- ML strategy will utilize cloud APIs (DeepSeek, OpenRouter) rather than local GPU compute

- Implement alerts panel component
- Create mock/dummy JSON data for Solana blockchain testing
- Setup Playwright test suite for dashboard navigation
- Setup Playwright test suite for component rendering with mock data
- Implement Solana wallet integration (mock functionality for design mode)
- Implement active positions widget with dummy Solana positions data
- Implement performance charts widget with dummy Solana trading data
- Implement risk metrics widget with dummy data
- Update Playwright tests to include performance and risk metrics
- Design ML strategy configuration component with reward function parameters
- Create API key management for DeepSeek and OpenRouter
- Implement model selection interface (DQN vs PPO vs Transformer-based)
- Create ML Strategy Design documentation
- Create API Integration Design documentation
- Set up settings page with tabbed navigation
- Setup responsive navigation system (sidebar/top navigation)
- Implement log viewer component for Solana transactions
- Add Playwright tests for sidebar navigation and log viewer functionality
- Implement responsive breakpoints and transitions for navigation
